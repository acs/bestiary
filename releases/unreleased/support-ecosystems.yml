    This feature allows to add, update and delete Ecosystems
    to Bestiary. 

    Ecosystems are meant to represent an abstract set of projects
    which may share a common context.

    An Ecosystem has an identifier and a name. Optionally, they may have
    a title and a description text. There is a new query allowing to get
    Ecosystems, including an optional filter to look for an specific ID or name. 

    There are three new mutations: `addEcosystem`, `updateEcosystem` and `deleteEcosystem`.
