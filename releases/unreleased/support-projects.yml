    This feature allows to add Projects to Bestiary.

    Projects are defined as a set of data locations which have
    to be grouped under the same entity. Moreover, this grouping
    may have a hierarchy by defining sub-projects.

    A Project has an identifier and a name, and it must belong to
    one single ecosystem . Optionally, they may have a title.
    There is a new query allowing to get Projects, including an
    optional filter to look for an specific ID or name.

    There is one new mutation: `addProject`.
