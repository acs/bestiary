    This feature allows to move a project to another parent project.

    A project can be moved to an existing project which now will be
    considered as its parent.

    This has some restrictions:
    - The project and its parent must belong to the same ecosystem.
    - If the project is not a root one, the parent cannot belong to
      a different root project.
    - A project cannot have a parent which is already one of its 
      descendants.
    - The parent cannot be already set to the project.

    There is a new mutation to perform this action, `moveProject`.
