notes: >
    This feature allows to perform authenticated queries
    to Bestiary. For doing so, a JWT (JSON Web Token)
    has to be generated and then included within the
    `Authorization` header in the HTTP requests.

    This feature includes the following methods:
    * `tokenAuth`: for creating new tokens, taking as input an existing
    username and its password.
    * `verifyToken`: for verifying existing tokens.
    * `refreshToken`: for generating a new valid token from another existing invalid one.

    These methods have to be used with their corresponding
    GraphQL mutations.
